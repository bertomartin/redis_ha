RedisHA
=======

A redis client that runs commands on multiple servers in parallel 
without blocking if one of them is down.

I used this to implement a highly available session store on top of
redis; it writes and reads the data to multiple instances and merges 
the responses after every read. This approach is negligibly slower 
than writing to a single server since RedisHA uses asynchronous I/O 
and is much more robust than complex server-side redis failover solutions
(sentinel, pacemaker, etcetera).

The gem includes three basic CRDTs (set, hashmap and counter).

Usage
-----

Create a RedisHA::ConnectionPool (connect does not block):

```ruby
pool = RedisHA::ConnectionPool.new
pool.connect(
  {:host => "localhost", :port => 6379},
  {:host => "localhost", :port => 6380},
  {:host => "localhost", :port => 6381}
)
```

Execute a command in parallel:

```ruby
>> pool.ping
=> ["PONG", "PONG", "PONG"]

>> pool.setnx "fnord", 1
=> [1,1,1]
```

RedisHA::Counter (INCR/DECR/SET/GET)

```ruby
>> ctr = RedisHA::Counter.new(pool, "my-counter")

>> ctr.set 3
=> true

>> ctr.incr
=> true

>> ctr.get
=> 4
```

RedisHA::HashMap (SET/GET) 

```ruby
>> map = RedisHA::HashMap.new(pool, "my-hashmap")

>> map.set(:fnord => 1, :fubar => 2)
=> true

=> map.get
=> {:fnord=>1, :fubar=>2}
```

RedisHA::Set (ADD/REM/GET)

```ruby
>> set = RedisHA::Set.new(pool, "my-set")

>> set.add(:fnord, :bar)
=> true

>> set.rem(:bar)
=> true

>> set.get
=> [:fnord]
```

Timeouts
--------

here be dragons


Caveats
--------

-> delete / decrement is not safe




Installation
------------

    gem install redis_ha

or in your Gemfile:

    gem 'redis_ha', '~> 0.3'
